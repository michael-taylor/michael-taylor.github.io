## History

I've been a professional software engineer since 2004. Before that, I had been tinkering with computer hardware and software as an amateur since the 1980s. I love the worlds that open up to you via playing video games, developing software, and piecing together hardware to make life easier.

## Current

Professionally, I work in the embedded industrial space. However, I spend a lot of free time working on various things that interest me. I enjoy video games, mostly sci-fi RPGs, and board games. I like working on Qt/KDE applications, and try to contribute to the KDE community whenever I can.

## Future

I hope to improve my writing and communication skills. Hopefully, this blog can help with that. I'd also like to become more involved in the open source communities that I benefit from.

## FAQ

### Comments aren't allowed on this blog. How can I give feedback?

### Where does "MisterTea" come from? It seems so unnecessarily formal.

MisterTea is simply a pronunciation of my initials, MRT, with the "T" stylized as Tea. Iced, sweet tea has long been my drink of choice.

### This blog's theme is lovely. What is it?

This blog is using the wonderful [FixIt](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt) theme.
